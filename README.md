## Problem
The financial markets move quickly, and staying informed with the most current data and news is critical for traders and financial analysts. However, the vast amount of information available can be overwhelming, and traditional methods of gathering and analyzing financial data and news are often time-consuming and inefficient. The key challenges include:
- Difficulty in quickly obtaining relevant and accurate stock symbols and financial data.
- Challenges in accessing consolidated real-time news that impacts financial markets.
- Need for effective visualization tools to interpret complex financial data intuitively.
